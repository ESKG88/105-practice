                <h4>Be Consistent!</h4>
                <p>When you start coding, it is helpful to come back to the lessons every or every other day.

                <p> Each day the information becomes more and more familiar. Spending too much time away from the lessons, makes you easily forget, makes you confused and feel like you can't do this or it doesn't make sense.

                <h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>
                <p>Give yourself some time to adjust and acclimate to the language. You are after all learning a new language!

                <p>It's normal to feel like you are not getting it. Sometimes you need to walk away for a minute do something else and come back.</p>
 
                <p>You can do this!</p>
